INMOAI

## Summary

My project is going to be a performance between a friend and me. We want to create an AI which can modify the prices of the buildings. These prices will be affected by the city, the distance to the beach and square meters. We want to make that with the same example of the buildings in the Building AI course. We live in South Europe and the price of the buildings change a lot of times in a year, mostly in summer. So, this is a good tool to obtain the most competitive and real prices. 

## Background

Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?

This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* I want to solve the volatility of the prices in the buildings.
* This problem is higher every year. 
* I love the idea that young people can buy a house. 
* Because we are living a bad situation in the prices of the houses for approx. 10 years ago in Europe.
